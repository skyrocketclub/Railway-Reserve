	We write this program with the assumption that there are Two stations (Yaba and Costain) and
	the admin only has to enter details of the train and the trips...
	
	We also assume that in these two stations, there are three routes each...

	Which route
		Show the trains available, which train?
			then show the details about that particular train at the moment
